Multiple Linear Regression on 50 Startups Dataset

This repository contains Python code implementing a Multiple Linear Regression model on the "50 Startups" dataset. The dataset includes information about different startups, such as R&D spending, administration spending, marketing spending, state, and profit.

Steps:
1. Data Importing: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. Data Preprocessing: Categorical data (state) is encoded using One-Hot Encoding.
3. Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training: A Multiple Linear Regression model is trained on the training set.
5. Prediction: The model is used to predict profits on the test set.
6. Evaluation: R-squared is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
   
R-squared Result: 93%
R-squared is a statistical measure that evaluates the goodness of fit of a regression model.
